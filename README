Code that permits to perform hand detection and (two) users detection and tracking. It has already configured some UDP messages being sent to a single IP and port.

Specifically:

- No pose required for skeleton tracking.
- Detects push and wave events.
- Detects the presence of two hands and sends a UDP message; it also sents a UDP message when the second hand is lost.
- Grabs location of the primary detected hand and sends it back to the specified IP.
- When the users are detected, starts tracking the users' hands positions and sends it back to the specified IP.
- When a hand and a user are detected or are lost, UDP messages are sent aswell.


Major configurable parts are located in define directives at the beginning of the file.

Projects both for Microsoft Visual Studio 10 and a makefile for OSX are provided.

The code is based on NITE middleware version v1.5.2.21.

GENERAL NOTES:

The code expects the file 'detector.xml' to be present either at the debug or release directories. The content of the file is as follows:



<OpenNI>
	<Licenses>
		<License vendor="PrimeSense" key="insert key here"/>
	</Licenses>
	<Log writeToConsole="true" writeToFile="false">

		<LogLevel value="3"/>
		<Masks>
			<Mask name="ALL" on="false"/>
		</Masks>

WINDOWS NOTES:

If you happen to have the error "fatal error RC1015: can not open include file 'afxres.h' " when compiling the project, it's easily solvable. Either change the line at the 'nite.rc' file where it says 'afxres.h' for 'windows.h', or create a new file 'afxres.h' and place code you will find elsewhere on the web ;)
